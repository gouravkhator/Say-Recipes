- [ ] More data to be fetched like the recipe making steps..
- [ ] Check and debug for following issues:
  - When I had put `bugs`, `homepage`, or `repository` fields in the `package.json`, ReactJS thought to serve the static files like css and optimized build of js files from `https://<hostname>:<port>/<my-git-profile-username>/<repo-name>/<static-file-name>`, instead of the usual url: `https://<hostname>:<port>/<static-file-name>`, and this issue led to 404 not found of that static file..
